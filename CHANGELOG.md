### 1.4.10

- Most API calls now present a 'Pryv-Access-Id' response header that contains the id of the access used for the call. This is the case only when a valid authorization token has been provided during the request (even if the token is expired).

### 1.4.9

- Improve the update account API call, in particular when it applies a change of email address. It now correctly checks if the email address is not already in use before updating the account and throws consistent errors.

### 1.4.5

- Refactor mongo duplicates management into storage layer.

### 1.4.4

- Events, Streams, Accesses, Profiles and FollowedSlices are now stored in single collections on MongoDB. This results in smaller per-user RAM usage.

## 1.3.X

- High Frequency events allow storing data at high frequency and high data 
  density. Create them by using types that start with 'series:X', where X 
  is a normal Pryv type. The API also supports inputting data into multiple 
  series at once, this is called a 'seriesBatch' (POST /series/batch).
  
- The api is internally using multiple processes to offload request handling 
  and json serialisation. This should allow much higher request rates, but your
  mileage may vary. Storage IOPS matter. 

- Some invalid requests that used to return a HTTP status code of 401
  (Unauthorized) now return a 403 (Forbidden). Only the requests that are
  missing some form of authentication will return a 401 code. 

- `updates.ignoreProtectedFields` is now off by default. This means that updates
  that address protected fields will result in an error being returned. 

- Accesses can now be set to expire via the `expireAfter` attribute. Expiry for 
  accesses gives you an easy way of limiting the damage that can be done using 
  a stolen access. 

- We've rehauled the 'delete-user' command of the Pryv.IO cli admin tool. It 
  now operates more explicitly and allows automation. 

- Improvements related to mongoDB:
  - We now use j:true as write concern, which requests acknowledgement that
    write operations has been written to the journal. This measure improves our
    persistence story in the face of a crash.
  - Implement user pool to anticipate users creation burst through two new API routes:
    POST 'system/pool/create-user' and GET 'system/pool/size'.
  - Make nightly tasks manually triggereable by sysadmins.

- Critical Security Fixes: 

  - 2018022101, 2018022102: Fixes to DNS server closing minor vulnerabilities: 
      DNS could be - under certain circumstances - used to exploit other systems. 

  - 2018091401: Fixes to the password reset mechanism; a bug would allow an 
      attacker to change passwords under certain circumstances. 

  - 2018102401: Details will be disclosed after Dec/18

- Implement fetch deleted accesses using `includeDeletions` in accesses.get API method

- Add clientData field to Accesses and create/update methods

- Fix a bug which prevented accesses with root ("streamId":"*") permission from managing sub-accesses correctly

- Remove some chown -R commands in our boot scripts, since it had the effect of delaying the start of the core node processes, for example if the data folder contains a lot of files (attachments). From now on, the recommendation is to run these commands independently in a sanitization script when installing or updating of the platform.

- Add `httpOnly` flag to server-side cookie sent in response to successful `/auth/login` request.

- Refactor mongo duplicates management into storage layer and make the related checks consistent among all the api-server methods.

## 1.2.X

- Fix login with Firefox (and other browsers using Referer but no Origin)

- Security fix 2018020801: 'accesses.update' was missing an authorisation check. 

- Update of the API version in API responses

- Blacklist usage errors from airbrake

- Fix events.get JSON formatting bug when retrieving ArraySize+1 events

- Improve tests stability: fix environment variable NODE_ENV

- Add configuration options to disable resetPassword and welcome emails

- Add configuration option to ignore updates of read-only fields

- Updates to latest nodejs version as a reaction to advisory 
  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/oct-2017-dos/

- Security fixes to various parts of Pryv: Now doesn't log passwords or password
  hashes as part of normal operation. 

- Please see Migration Guide for implications on your infrastructure. 

- Tags have a maximum length of 500 characters. An error is returned from the 
  API when this limit is exceeded. 

- When two users would log in at almost the same time, we had a insert/update 
  data race. This should be fixed now. 

- Instead of blacklisting the fields that the user cannot update, we now
  whitelist those that he can. 

## v0.8.x

Changes:

- Deletion methods now:
    - Reply to permanent deletions with a `{item}Deletion` field confirming the
      deleted item's identifier
    - Always return code 200 on HTTP (that's a rollback of the v0.7.x change
      which was a bit too zealous to be practical)

New features:

- Event and stream deletions are now kept for sync purposes; they're accessible 
  via parameter `includeDeletions` (`events.get`) or `includeDeletionsSince` 
  (`streams.get`). Deletions are cleaned up after some time (currently a year).


## v0.7.x

Major changes here towards more standardization and flexibility:

- All JSON responses (both in HTTP and Socket.IO) are now structured as follows:
    - `{ "{resource}": {...} }` if a single resource item is expected; for 
      example: `{ "event": {...} }`, `{ "error": {...} }`
    - `{ "{resources}": [ {...}, ... ] }` if an indeterminate number of items 
      is expected; for example: `{ "events": [ {...}, ... ] }`
    
- All responses to resource creation and update calls now include the full 
  object instead of respectively its id and nothing; for example: `{ "stream": 
  {...} }`
  
- All JSON responses now include `meta.apiVersion` and `meta.serverTime` 
  properties mirroring the original `API-Version` and `Server-Time` HTTP 
  headers; HTTP header `API-Version` remains
  
- Deleting a resource now returns code 204 if the item was permanently deleted; 
  it still returns a 200 when trashed (now including the trashed item in the 
  response)
  
- Method ids for deletion/trashing are now `{resource}.delete` instead of 
  `{resource}.del`
- The `attachments` property of events is now an array (instead of an object), 
  with each attachment now identified by a new `id` property (instead of 
  `fileName`)

- As a security measure, reading attached files now either requires auth via 
  the `Authorization` HTTP header or a new `readToken` query string parameter 
  (`auth` isn't allowed anymore in this case); the token to use is specific to 
  each file and access, and is defined in the `readToken` property of each 
  event attachment
  
- Event batch creation method has been replaced with generic batch method 
  (`callBatch`, HTTP: `POST /`)
  
- Bookmarks have been renamed to "followed slices", corresponding method ids to 
  `followedSlices.*` and HTTP routes to `/followed-slices`
  
- Getting events: setting the `tags` parameter now returns events with *any* of 
  the specified tags, instead of *all* of them
  
- Error ids:
  - `unknown-*` errors replaced with either `unknown-resource` or 
    `unknown-referenced-resource`
  - `item-*-already-exists` replaced with `item-already-exists`
  - `missing-parameter` replaced with `invalid-parameters-format`

- Other improvements and fixes (data validation performance, minor bugs on auth 
  for trusted apps)

New features:

- Getting events: filter for specific event types with the `types` parameter

- Accesses can now define tag permissions in `permissions` (in addition to the 
  existing stream permissions)
  
  - If only tag permissions are set, all streams are considered readable, and 
    vice-versa
  - When stream and tag permissions conflict, the highest permission level is 
    considered
  
- Full support for managing account information, including password change and 
  reset


## v0.6.x

Changes to HTTP paths and auth for trusted apps:

- Get streams: removed `trashed` option for `state` as it was more trouble than 
  anything useful
  
- Accesses now includes property `id` (exposed for referencing)
    - Create access response now includes both `id` and `token` properties
    - For existing accesses, `id` and `token` are equal
  
- Events, streams and accesses now includes change tracking properties:
    - `created` and `modified` (timestamp)
    - `createdBy` and `modifiedBy` (access id or `"system"`)
  
- Socket.IO method calls now directly use method ids (e.g. `events.create`  and 
  pass method params, instead of using `command` and passing an object with 
  method id and params
  
- For trusted apps only: removed the distinction between "admin" methods and 
  others; (**breaking changes**)

  - `/admin/login`, `/admin/logout` and `/admin/who-am-i` moved to 
    `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout` and `/auth/who-am-i` respectively
  - `sessionID` renamed to `token` in login response and SSO cookie data
  - *Personal* accesses are now automatically created on login; they can't be 
    created explicitly anymore
  - `/admin/user-info` moved to `/user-info`
  - `/admin/accesses` merged into `/accesses`
  - `/admin/bookmarks` moved to `/bookmarks`
  - `/admin/profile` merged into `/profile`
  
- Configuration: renamed `clients` section to `auth` and added SSO and session 
  settings
  
- Updated Node.js version to 0.10.23

- Removed dependency on ZeroMQ (replaced by pure Node.js lib)


## v0.5.2

This is a major update that will break most libs and clients, which should be
updated ASAP.

- Simplified the API by removing channels and renamed folders into "streams";
  adjusted the structure of accesses, streams and events accordingly; more
  details:
  
  - As a consequence, every event now belongs to a stream
  - Data migration: former channels will be converted into root-level streams, 
    and former folders into sub-streams of those

- Events structure:
  - `event.type` is now a string of format `{class}/{format}` (e.g.
    `picture/attached`) instead of an object with `class` and `format`
    properties
  - `event.value` has been renamed to `event.content`

- Get events:
  - Renamed parameter `onlyFolders` to just `streams`
  - Added `running` boolean parameter, replacing "get running periods" method

- Removed "get running periods" (i.e. `GET /events/running`, see above)

- Removed `hidden` property of streams (ex-folders), which was mostly unused 
  and out of place


## v0.4.16

- New feature: Allow HTTP method overriding by POSTing _method, _json, and _auth
  parameters in an URL-encoded request

- Improvement: Retrieving events for a specific timeframe now includes all
  events that overlap that timeframe, including period events that started
  earlier


## v0.4.13

- Added event type validation: the API will now check if an event being created
  or updated has a known type (as listed on our event types directory), and if
  yes perform data validation on its value (returning a 400 error if invalid)


## v0.4.6

- All error ids have been changed to use `slug-style` instead of
  `C_CONSTANT_STYLE` (so that e.g. `INVALID_PARAMETERS_FORMAT` is now
  `invalid-parameters-format`); this is consistent with the other ids we’re
  using in the system
