# service-core

Pryv.io core server app components, i.e. what runs on each server node and handles user data.


## Installation

Prerequisites:
- `make` and support for C/C++ compilation
  - Linux: e.g. `sudo apt-get install build-essentials`
  - MacOS: e.g. `xcode-select --install` (installs command line tools)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 16
  - Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage multiple versions
- Mongo DB 4.2 (needs at least 4GB of free disk space for the initial database)
  - MacOS & Linux: already included in `scripts/setup-dev-env`
- InfluxDB 1.2
  - Linux: `scripts/setup-influx`
  - MacOS: e.g. `brew install influxdb@1`
- nats-server
  - Linux: `scripts/setup-nats-server`
  - MacOS: e.g. `brew install nats-server`
- graphicsmagick (for image events preview)
  - Linux: e.g. `sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick`
  - MacOS: e.g. `brew install graphicsmagick`
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation)

Then:
1. `just setup-dev-env` to setup local file structure and install MongoDB
2. `just install [--no-optional]` to install node modules


## Dev environment basics

The project is structured as a monorepo with components (a.k.a. workspaces in NPM), each component defining its `package.json`, tests, configs, etc. in `components/<name>/`.

Scripts are run with [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just):
```
just <command> [params]
```
Notes:
- Running `just` with no argument displays the commands defined in `justfile`, which should cover all usual needs. (Typical usage examples are included throughout this document.)
- `just` works consistently from anywhere within the project directory.
- No NPM scripts.

Everything should be accessible from the project root, including running commands on a particular component (typically via `just <command> <component> ...`). We keep things consistent across components, with as much as possible defined just once at the root level; in particular:
- All NPM dependencies are kept in the root `package.json`
- Only basic properties are kept in each component's `package.json`

The code follows the [Semi-Standard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) style.
- Run `just lint` to check linting on the entire repo
- Run `just lint-changes` to only check modified files
- Add the `--fix` option to either of the above to automatically fix issues when possible.


## Running service dependencies

The servers and the tests depend on NATS server, MongoDB and InfluxDB.
```
just start-deps
```
to get them all running at once.


## Testing

**⚠️ As of 2022-04, `audit` tests related to syslog fail on ARM-64 (M1) Macs.**

```
just test <component> [...params]
```
- `component` is an existing component's name, or `all` to run tests on all components
- Extra parameters at the end are passed on to [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (default settings are defined in `.mocharc.js` files)
- Replace `test` with `test-detailed`, `test-debug`, `test-cover` for common presets

For example:
- `just test all` to test all components using default settings
- `just test-detailed api-server --bail` to test component `api-server` with detailed output, stopping on the first test failure

### Useful Mocha parameters

- `--bail` stops on the first test failure
- `--grep <text>` only runs tests matching the given text (typically used with test ids, see below)

See [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage) for the full reference.

### Controlling console output during tests

With env variables:
- `LOGS=<level>` to show spawned server instances output (level: `info`, `warn`, `error`)
- `DEBUG="*"` to show debug information

### Test ids tagging

```
just tag-tests
```
to tag yet-untagged test cases with a (hopefully) unique id for unambiguous reference. The scripts issues warnings if duplicate ids or programmatically-generated ids are found (as the latter escape the duplicates check). Note as well that the [dev-site](https://github.com/pryv/dev-site) will fail to build if there are missing ids or duplicates in the generated test results (see below).

### Generating test results

```
just test-results-(init-repo|generate|upload)
```
Test results are kept in the [dev-test-results](https://github.com/pryv/dev-test-results) repository and published on the dev site.
- `just test-results-init-repo` to checkout the repository locally
- `just test-results-generate` to run the test suite and save the results to `test-results/service-core/${TAG_VERSION}/${TIMESTAMP}-service-core.json`
- `just test-results-upload` to upload the results


## Debugging

Add your breakpoints, then `just test-debug` to run tests in debug mode.

For debugging by hand, old-school:
- Print server 500 errors: uncomment the line containing `uncomment to log 500 errors on test running using InstanceManager` in `…/errorHandling.js`
- Print server `console.log`: uncomment the line with `stdio: 'inherit'` in `…/InstanceManager.js`


## Tracing

```
just trace
```
to start the tracing service (Jaeger).


## Data migration

```
just run api-server migrate
```
to trigger data migration. Migrations are defined in the `storage` component.


## Local Docker containers

See [dedicated README](build/test/README.md).


## Security assessment

```
just security-assessment
```
to run security assessment and write output to `security-assessment` (assumes `coverage` data to be present).

See other `just security-assessment-*` commands for what's available. Some require additional software such as [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), Docker engine and [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).



## Developing on core and depended-upon packages simultaneously

Sometimes it's necessary to work on core and e.g. `@pryv/boiler` or `@pryv/datastore` at the same time.

1. Open the working copies of core and the desired package(s) in the same workspace (e.g. for VSCode, from the parent folder, run `code service-core pryv-datastore`)
2. From `service-core`, run `npx link {package working copy path}` (e.g. `npx link ../pryv-datastore`)

When you're done with the side-by-side work, `just install` to cleanup and resume using the regular package dependencies.


## App Configuration

Components supporting configuration load their settings from (last takes precedence):

1. Default values, as defined in the [base configuration](https://github.com/pryv/service-core/blob/master/components/utils/src/config.js#L20) or the component's own
2. A JSON file specified by setting `config`, defaulting to `config/{env}.json` (`env` can be `production`, `development` or `test`); typically used for per-environment settings. This variant is deprecated and will be faded out.
3. An additional "overrides" JSON file specified by setting 'configOverrides'; typically used for confidential settings (e.g. keys, secrets). This variant is deprecated and will be faded out.
4. Environment variables; default naming scheme: `PRYV_SETTING_KEY_PATH` (for example, `PRYV_DATABASE_HOST` for `database`→`host`). This variant is deprecated and will be faded out.
5. Command-line options as `--key=value`; default naming scheme: `setting:key:path` (for example, `database:host` for `database`→`host`). This variant is deprecated and will be faded out.

To specify a configuration file, please use `--config` with a relative or absolute path. This will be the way to configure Pryv.io for the near future.

Those components also accept the following command line options:

- `--help` displays all available configuration settings as a schema structure (and exits)
- `--printConfig` prints the configuration settings actually loaded (e.g. for debugging purposes)


## Customizing server behaviour

It is possible to extend the API and previews servers with custom code, via the configuration keys defined under `customExtensions/`:

- `defaultFolder`: The folder in which custom extension modules are searched for by default. Unless defined by its specific setting (see other settings in `customExtensions`), each module is loaded from there by its default name (e.g. `customAuthStepFn.js`), or ignored if missing. Defaults to `{app root}/custom-extensions`.
- `customAuthStepFn`: A Node module identifier (e.g. `/custom/auth/function.js`) implementing a custom auth step (such as authenticating the caller id against an external service). The function is passed the method context, which it can alter, and a callback to be called with either no argument (success) or an error (failure). If this setting is not empty and the specified module cannot be loaded as a function, server startup will fail. Undefined by default.

    ```javascript
    // Example of customAuthStepFn.js
    module.exports = function (context, callback) {
      // do whatever is needed here (check LDAP, custom DB, etc.)
      doCustomParsingAndValidating(context, function (err, parsedCallerId) {
        if (err) { return callback(err); }
        context.originalCallerId = context.callerId;
        context.callerId = parsedCallerId;
        callback();
      });
    };
    ```

    Available context properties (as of now):

    - `username` (string)
    - `user` (object): the user object (properties include `id`)
    - `accessToken` (string): as read in the `Authorization` header or `auth` parameter
    - `callerId` (string): optional additional id passed after `accessToken` in auth after a separating space (auth format is thus `<access-token>[ <caller-id>]`)
    - `access` (object): the access object (see [API doc](https://pryv.github.io/reference/#access) for structure)


## About event types definitions

The default event types definitions (`components/business/src/types/event-types.default.json`) must be kept up-to-date.
```
just update-event-types
```
to fetch them from the "reference" version published online. (The API server also tries to update this asynchronously at startup but fallbacks to the default definitions in the meantime and if the online version is unavailable or corrupted.)


## Troubleshooting

### Test failures

If you're running into a lot of test failures, it may be because your Mongo database is empty, so try to `just test storage` first.

If you are getting multiple seemingly unrelated errors following a branch switch, try to `just clean`.

### Docker installation on Linux

If you are trying to run `docker <some command>` and getting the following error:

```log
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.26/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

You should add the current user to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`

After running this command, in your shell, log out of your account and log back in, reboot if needed.
Run `docker run hello-world` to check if it works.

([Reference](https://techoverflow.net/2017/03/01/solving-docker-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket/))

### InfluxDB "too many open files" error

Delete your local influx DB files and reboot Influx DB:

```
rm ~/.influxdb/data/*
influxd
```

Or increase the number of authorized files using: `ulimit -n 1024` (or more if needed)
