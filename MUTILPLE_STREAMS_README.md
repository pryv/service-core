# Modifiying an event with mutiple streams 

Current: is only allowed if context can contribute to "ALL" streamIds this event is attached too.

Future: to be discussed

Implementation: method:events: function applyPrerequisitesForUpdate

# reading events in multiple streams

Is allowed if at least one stream is readable

Q? should we remove the "streamIds" no visible?
