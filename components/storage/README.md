### Tests

- `npm run test` (or `npm test`) for quiet output
- `npm run test-detailed` for detailed test specs and debug log output
- `npm run test-profile` for profiling the tested server instance and opening the processed output with `tick-processor`
- `npm run test-debug` is similar as `npm run test-detailed` but in debug mode; it will wait for a debugger to be attached on port 5858
