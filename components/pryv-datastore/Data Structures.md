# Mall - Data Structures

## Events

Events data model is very similar to events exposed by the API with some differences. The following table exposes the expected data model.

https://api.pryv.com/reference/#event

| Field       | Index | Type                     | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| id          | X     | string                   | a **unique** value within the store.                   |
| headId      | X     | string \| null           | "historical event" an Id refering to the "root" event. |
| streamIds   | X     | Array of string          | array of Stream Ids. Cannot be empty                   |
| time        | X     | timestamp                |                                                        |
| endTime     | X     | timestamp \| null        | endTime is computed from an to "duration" API event    |
| type        | X     | string                   | The type of the event.                                 |
| content     |       | Object \| null           |                                                        |
| description |       | string                   |                                                        |
| attachments |       | Array of **Attachments** | Only for Store supporting attachements                 |
| clientData  |       | Key-Value                |                                                        |
| trashed     | X     | boolean                  | `true` if the event is in the trash                    |
| integrity   |       | string                   | As per integrity specification                         |
| created     |       | timestamp                | When the data was created                              |
| createdBy   | X     | string                   | Identifier of the Access that created the data.        |
| modified    | X     | timestamp                |                                                        |
| modifedBy   | X     | string                   | Identifier of the Access that created the data.        |
| deleted     |       | timestamp \| null        | When set the event is marked as deleted                |

Events can be 3 states "live", "historical", "deleted". Depending on each states some fields are mandatory.

- **live**
  - **Non-null fields**: id, streamIds (should contain at least one streamId), time, type, created createdBy, modified, modifiedBy
  - **Must be null**: deleted, headId
- **historical**
  - **Non-null fields**: headId, id
- **deleted**
  - **Non-null fields**: deleted, id


## Attachements 

### Creating events with attachments 

In order to compute `integrity` property for attachments and events, the creation of events is done in two phases. 

1- **Loading the attachment with** `mall.events.loadAttachmentFor(partialEventData, attachmentsItems, attachmentsInformations, finalizeEvent)`


## Ids

Discussion: Events, Stream and Attachments ids might be generated by stores directly to match their internal organization. 
Proposal: add `store.events.newId(partialEvent)` , `store.events.newAttachmentId(partialEvent, attachmentInfos)`
