# Notes and Todo 

Keep track of question and tasks

- Perki: For login, I set the access.id to 'password' <= to be discussed
    Same for Account / changePassword and requestResetPassword

Hard coded ids:
  - password
  - password-reset-request
  - password-reset-token

Was implemented in dnsLess=False but seems it was never used
