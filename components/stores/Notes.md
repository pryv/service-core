# Concepts 
### "Store Properties" 
To be discussed, whether this is exposed or we create specific error when something unsupported is done on the storage.

**preffered would be to send error messages** (for the 1st iteration)
- supportsAttachments 'no', 'single', 'multiple'
- supportsEventStreaming true / false
- supportsSeries true / false
- supportsStreamsClientData
- supportsEventsClientData
- supportsEventsSorting



### "StreamdIds" 
- localStorage is unchanged
- dynamic or "mounted" sources have a "root" stream that starts with a "." 
- to ensure non-collision dynamic sources streamiD will be named spaced with their root id by service-core
  Example ".account/email" for "email" stream exposed by "account" data source

### "Stream Lists" `streams.get`
- To avoid exposing full stream structure or querying too often remote resources. We might not expose other storage than localStorage stream unless explicitly specified. Then we need to provide a "discovery" mechanism for these streams
  example: `stream.get()` could return 
  ```
  [{
    id: '.account',
    children-hidden: true,
   },
   {
     id: 'diary', 
     ....
   }

  ]
  ```
  exemple: `stream.get({parentIds: ['*', '.account']})` would return all streams and `.account` substreams

#### stream.get new Parameter `parentIds`
- In order to explore stores streams, parentIds would replace parentId:
- It would accept ['.*', '*'] to get all `cachable` streams 
- To avoid duplicates or stream tree consolidation, Only one streamId per scope can be specified otherwise => error


### Event association to stores & `events.get` 
- Events ids will not be sufficient in a "multi-storage" set-up 
  - No way to do a "delete" or "update" without knowing the storage it applies. 
  - We then introduce 'namespacing' of event id to their store eg: id: '.account-cjhsadhasjhdajsasd' 
    Note: this would break 'cuid' checks 

- Moving an event from one to the other is not possible without changing its id.. 
  - So "events.update" should either accept id updates or we just let the dev to a create / delete 

- **Sorting & Limit** cannot be implemented at the short term within multiple storage query. 
  - Doc should be updated to indicate that by default stores' events will be given in an uncontrolled when querying multiple storage. 
  - Explicit sort: asc or desc will return an "unsupported" error on multiple store query or on stores that do not support sorting.
  - Limit cannot be enforced if sorting is not .. 

- **StreamQuery** 'blocks' will be supported on a "per storage" basis.
  - A Query `{ any: ['.account', 'diary']}` will return an error with a message indicating that query cannot mix storage (per block). `{ any: ['.account'], {any: ['diary']}` will be valid. 
  - **ExpandStream** Expanding streams can be a complex task that might be handled directly by the storage. For example if a stores exposes a file system it will be easier to pass the query `{any:  ['$find .volume-myfolder'], {not: ['$find .volume-myfolder/private']}}`  than to get all the files in `myfolder` and its sub directories while ignoring the ones in `private` . The storage could translate this in `find --ignore=myfolder/private myfolder` .
    - Storage can expose an `expandStream`  
  
#### Multiple stream limitations
- Multiple streams between data-source need a data-source of "reference" as the event will not be copied "twice"
  - This could be achieved if the reference store supports multiple streams and other stores supports event-references
    ex: `{event: { id: '.account-c1111', streamIds: ['.account-username', 'private'] } }`
    then a reference event could be stored in the stream 'private' of localStorage with `{reference: '.account-c1111'}`
  - The proposal will induce a lot of overheads if the content of the event is not fully copied (ex fromTime toTime query)
- At 1st step I propose to throw a new Error `multiple-streams-cross-store-not-supported`





### Streams and exploration of non cachable structures
- Some streams structures might not be available or too big to be fully stored or cached (e.g. a file system)
  - Add a new property to streams: 'nonCachableChildrens: true" to indicate (some) children cannot be cached.
    **Alternative** add a 'containsNonCachableChildrens' item in the children list <= not preferred
  - 'nonCachable' property is added to streams that cannot be cached.
  - 'nonCachable' substreams are 'nonCachable' 
  - To be sure we can give ACR to a nonCachable stream: 
    ids of nonCachable streams must include full path to reach them e.g. id of "Documents" `.filesystem-root/User/tom/Documents` 
    This implies that if "Documents" is moved then its id changes. 

**Note:**
  - streams.get({parentId:[...]}) should include the streamId to get the children.
  - a new parameters 'includeNonCachable: true' might be introduced (could produce huge amount of data) 

### Defaults and unknown values
- For some Stores, some value are unkown for example 'createdAt' or 'modifiedBy' 
  - in this case the value is explicitly set to 'UNKOWN' <== and we have to make it a protected word
  - Question (what to do for numerical values) ? For example 'modifiedSince' ? 

### "Caching permission per access" for non cachable Streams
Out of scope but still relevant to check that the logic can allow optimization

To have fast check of permission per access we could cache the following table.
              
{streamid} | streams.get | streams.create | streams.update | events.get | events.create | events.update

```
For non-cachable stream eg.
.filesystem-root/User/tom | true | true .... 

When a events.get is done on .filesystem-root/User/tom/Documents 
// 1- check it's non cachable 
// 2- loop the "path" recusrively 
function getRightsNonCachable(streamId) {
  const path = streamId.split('/');
  do {
    const rights = rights[path.join('/)];
    if (rights) return rights;
    path.pop();
  } while(path.length > 0);
  return null;
}

// return the rights for a stream
function getRights(streamId) {Â }

getRights('.filesystem-root/User/tom/Documents');

```

### List of new errors

- multiple-streams-cross-store-not-supported 
- resource-is-read-only: when rights have been granted to 
- feature-no-supported-by-store: generic error for attachments, series (could even be used for read-only) 

### Change Log

- Refactored `accessLogic`
  - Made a `class` instead of js structure clone + merge so simulate inheritance
  - StreamQueries:
    - Add "storeId" grouping: each streamQuery is associated with a storeId
    - Using callbacks instead of "streamId array" for isAuthorized or isAccessible to enable dev of lazy loading of ACRs 
  - MethodContext:
    - Removing unecessary sugar (Forwarding to accessLogic)
  - AccessLogic:
    - Renaming accessLogic to explicit ACR methods names
      - canReadStream => canGetEventsOnStream
      - canContributeToStream => canCreateSubStream & canCreateEventsOnStream
      - canUpdateStream => canUpdateStream & canUpdateEventsOnStream
      - ...
    - Making sure that each context.access.{call} represents a single clear ACL
    - When possible uses context.access.can(context.apiCallId) to authorize the call 
- Side effects:
  - `methods/events` is passed to async method. (this also allowed to use getConfig() instead of getConfigUsafe())
