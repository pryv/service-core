# This file installs all dependencies needed to run core for tests

# Install gnatsd - the duplicate of ./core/gnatsd.sh file that consist docker 
# run commands
sh ../scripts/setup-gnatsd.sh

# Install mongodb
bash ../scripts/setup-dev-env.bash

# Install influxdb
sh ../scripts/setup-influx.sh

#======================================================================
# If the scrip is run several times, this could fail because of occupied ports
# but in the isolated environment like docker it is ok, but for local machine 
# installation could cause confusion

# Go to the parrent directory
cd ..

# Start gnatsd (the same as `yarn nats`, just in the background)
./gnatsd &

# Start mongodb
yarn database

# Start Influx db and verify the status
service influxdb start
service influxdb status
