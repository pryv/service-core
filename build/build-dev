sh ./scripts/setup-gnatsd.sh

# Install mongodb
bash ./scripts/setup-dev-env.bash

# Install influxdb
sh ./scripts/setup-influx.sh

#======================================================================
# If the scrip is run several times, this could fail because of occupied ports
# but in the isolated environment like docker it is ok, but for local machine 
# installation could cause confusion

# Go to the parrent directory

# Start gnatsd (the same as `yarn nats`, just in the background)

# Start Influx db and verify the status
sudo service influxdb start
